# Sigma4: 3D Connect 4 AI Challenge

## Project Team
- Anthony DeFoe

- Jonathan Rivard

## Objective
The primary goal of the Sigma4 project is to develop an AI agent capable of competing against human players in a 3D version of the classic game Connect 4. Our AI will demonstrate:
- **Strategic Decision-Making:** Ability to make complex decisions that challenge human opponents.
- **Tactical Prowess:** Utilization of tactical maneuvers learned through self-play.
- **Algorithm Implementation:** Integration of traditional AI techniques and modern deep learning algorithms.

## Game Overview
3D Connect4 is played on a 4x4x4 grid by two participants. The objective for each player is to align four of their tokens either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This three-dimensional play adds a layer of complexity to the traditional Connect 4 game, providing a unique challenge that tests both the player's and the AI's strategic planning skills.
